# Build Neural Network

You will build a deep neural network with as many layers as you want!

In this notebook, you'll implement all the functions required to build a deep neural network.

By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to:

+ Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model;
  
+ Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer);
  
+ Implement an easy-to-use neural network class.
